Hi.

So, I set up a new little blog thingie using github pages and jekyll. I wanted a quick and simple blog platform so I could jot down stuff from time to time when I ran across cool stuff or whatnot. It took all of about 20 minutes and I highly recommend it for anybody that wants a quick 'n dirty static site or blog platform (free of charge no less).

Now -- for inspiration and content (... to be continued).
